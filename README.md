# PentaSaber
A remake of PentaToggle, the old ChromaToggle game mode. Each saber has an alternate color activated by pressing trigger. Optional neutral blocks are inserted between transitions.

## Configuration
Currently, settings must be adjusted in `UserData\PentaSaber.json` (including whether the mod is enabled/disabled).

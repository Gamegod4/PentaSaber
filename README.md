# PentaSaber
A remake of PentaToggle, the old ChromaToggle game mode. Each saber has an alternate color activated by pressing trigger. Optional neutral blocks are inserted between transitions.

## Edit notes from Gamegod4
This is my attempt to build off of the work that Zingabopp has done to restore this mod. I am not really a modder, nor do I fully understand everything here, but I have always loved this game mode from the days of ChromaToggle when it was around and have been missing it ever since. After I found out about this remake I just had to make sure to get it. I was on an older version of the game and had to make tweaks, and due to game updates make even more. Now I feel that it would be nice if others got to enjoy the mod again, and so here is my attempt to restore what I can.

## Current known issues from Gamegod4's edits
-Sets of notes might be different colors at times. I don’t know of how to fix it, but it should be fine most of the time
-Block colors might not change sometimes. This is likely do to chroma and can be fixed by setting chroma block changing to off
-The new slider and arc notes are not quite working with this version. I’m not sure how to fix it, but you should have what you need to play fine most of the time

## Configuration
Currently, settings must be adjusted in `UserData\PentaSaber.json` (including whether the mod is enabled/disabled).
